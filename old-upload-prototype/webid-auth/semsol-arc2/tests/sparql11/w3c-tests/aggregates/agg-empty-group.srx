    IMPORTANT NOTE: because query in file agg-empty-group.rq looks like SELECT ?x (MAX(?value) AS ?max),
                    the head has to contain x as variable too. in other files, such variables are available too.

                    another change is the removal of spaces between <result> and </result>.
